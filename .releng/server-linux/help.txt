This is the distribution for the standalone xOWL server.
xOWL Server is a Triple Store server. It is able to store, manage and serve datasets for the semantic web.

This distribution contains:
* 'xowl-server.conf', the configuration file for the server
* 'xowl-server.jar', the Java application for the server

* 'do-run.sh', the launch script for the server
* 'install-daemon.sh', the script to install the xOWL server as a Linux service
* 'uninstall-daemon.sh', the script to uninstall the Linux service
* 'admin.sh', the administration script for the Linux service


To simply launch the server:

$ sh do-run.sh

The web application for the administration of the server is available at: https://localhost:3443/web/
The default administrator is:
* login: admin
* password: admin

The server can be stopped or restart from the web application.
Otherwise, killing the launch script will also trigger a clean shutdown of the server.


To run the server as a Linux service, first register the service with:

$ sh install-daemon.sh

The service can then be managed with the usual commands:

$ service xowl-server start|stop|status|restart

The service can be uninstalled with:

$ sh uninstall-daemon.sh
