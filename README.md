This is the xOWL Infrastructure, a set of components for working with OWL2 ontologies and building graphical Domain-Specific Modeling Languages based on ontologies.


### Notable Features ###

* Ontologies
	* Load and manipulate RDF and OWL2 datasets (N-Triples, N-Quads, Turtle, RDF/XML, Functional OWL Syntax)
	* OWL2-based rule and query engines
	* OWL2 ontology transformations
	* Expression of behaviors in ontologies with xOWL
	* Executions of xOWL ontologies
* Domain-Specific Modeling
	* Specification of domain-specific graphical concrete syntaxes
	* Construction of Domain-Specific Modeling Languages based on ontologies


### How to build ###

To build, use Maven:

```
$ mvn clean package
```
