# xOWL Infrastructure - Generator #

This component implements code generation capabilities for Java and the semantic web.
It enables the generation of Java code that implements (with hypotheses) the semantics of OWL2 ontologies.
For example, this component is used to generate the lang component, which implements in Java the data model of the xOWL language.
