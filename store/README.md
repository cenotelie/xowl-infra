# xOWL Infrastructure - Store #

This component implements the base infrastructure for storing and manipulating datasets.
It can be used to embed semantic web capabilities in an application:

* Import RDF data in N-Triple, N-Quad, Turtle, RDF/XML and JSON-LD syntaxes
* Import OWL2 data in OWL/XML and Functional OWL syntaxes
* Import RDF-based rules in the xRDF syntax
* Import OWL2-based rules in the xOWL syntax
* Export RDF data in N-Triple, N-Quad, Turtle, RDF/XML and JSON-LD syntaxes
* Export OWL2 data in OWL/XML and Functional OWL syntaxes
* Manipulate RDF graphs
* Manipulate business entities mapped to RDF data
* Query datasets with RDF-specific queries
* Query datasets with OWL2-specific queries
* Execute inference rules over datasets with RDF-specific and OWL2-specific rules
* Reason over datasets with RDF, RDFS and OWL2 semantics
